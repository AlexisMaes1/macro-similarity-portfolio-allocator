# macro-similarity-portfolio-allocator
A fully data-driven portfolio allocation strategy based on macroeconomic regime detection. The model identifies the current macro regime, finds historically similar periods, extracts realized asset behavior, builds expected returns and covariances, and optimizes a constrained multi-asset portfolio with a target volatility.
